How long would each of these operations take in Big O
notation?

1. 4.5 Printing the value of each element in an array.
ans = O(n)

2. 4.6 Doubling the value of each element in an array.
ans = O(n)

3. 4.7 Doubling the value of just the first element in an array.
ans = O(1)

1. 4.8 Creating a multiplication table with all the elements
in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first
multiply every element by 2, then multiply every.
ans = O(nÂ²)
