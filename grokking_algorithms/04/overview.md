- The **Divide and Conquer (DC)** strategy works by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems. If you're using DC on a list, the base case will likely be an empty array or an array with only one element.

- If you're implementing **quicksort**, choose a random element as the pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is **O(n log n)**!

- The constant in **Big O notation** can be relevant in some cases. This is why quicksort is faster than merge sort.

- The constant is hardly relevant when comparing **linear search** to **binary search**, since **O(log n)** is much faster than **O(n)** when your list is large.
