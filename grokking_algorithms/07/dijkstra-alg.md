- Breadth-first search is used to calculate the shortest path in an **unweighted graph**.
- **Dijkstra's algorithm** is used to calculate the shortest path in a **weighted graph**.
- Dijkstra's algorithm works when **all weights are positive**.
- If your graph has **negative weights**, use the **Bellman-Ford algorithm**.
