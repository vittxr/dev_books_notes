A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure is distinguished by its rooted nature and the designated positions of its children. 

Key characteristics of a binary tree include:

- **Nodes:** Each node in a binary tree typically contains data and pointers (or references) to its left and right children.
- **Root:** The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root. 
- **Leaves:** Nodes that do not have any children are called leaves or leaf nodes.
- **Subtrees:** The left and right children of a node, along with their descendants, form the left and right subtrees, respectively.

Types of binary trees include:

- **Full Binary Tree:** Every node has either zero or two children.
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
- **Perfect Binary Tree:** All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
- **Balanced Binary Tree:** The heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Examples include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A special type of binary tree where for each node, all values in its left subtree are less than its own value, and all values in its right subtree are greater. This property facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Binary trees are fundamental in various algorithms and data structures, including sorting algorithms (like heap sort), efficient data storage and retrieval systems, and representing hierarchical relationships.
